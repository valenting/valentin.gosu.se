<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>A few days ago was Mozilla's 15 birthday. Not bad for a company that deals in Open Source software. As a celebration, Mozilla volunteers shared their story with the #webstory tag on twitter. Considering I'm not a big twitter guy, I think a blog post will do.<br /><br />My first interaction with Mozilla was through Firefox. I was a user since version 1, or even earlier if my memory serves me right. By 2008, when I started university I was already a tried and tested user. However, I had no idea of what Mozilla actually stood for. I then attended a presentation by <a class="g-profile" href="https://plus.google.com/107887636157279037469" target="_blank">+Alina Mierlus</a> and <a class="g-profile" href="https://plus.google.com/100369926401304994128" target="_blank">+Toni Hermoso Pulido</a> about the Mozilla community and I was hooked. It became my community with the values I supported. Soon enough I started hosting events, became a Mozilla Rep and a small contributor.<br /><br />My hope is that it won't end here. I have big plans to support Mozilla until the end. I know of no other company that does so much to fight for its users' rights. And I see only good things in Mozilla's future.
