It is more than a saying, but a belief that goes down to the core of every engineer, and every volunteer helping drive the web forward. There are no shareholders and no "customers". Only the users and the web.<br /><br />I am joining the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Networking">networking team</a>, a small group of people that are very dear to me. I was an intern on this same team a couple of years ago, and during that time I came to appreciate how awesome all of them are. Right now I am the youngest on the team, the n00b, but I've got a lot to learn, and very talented people to learn from.<br /><br />"Flame on!" <br />
