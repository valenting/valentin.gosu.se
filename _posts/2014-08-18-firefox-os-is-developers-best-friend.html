<div style="text-align: justify;">Up until recently I wasn't able to appreciate the full potential of a Firefox OS phone. I only looked at it as a consumer product, a cheap way for people in developing countries to get access to the internet. I had never considered its potential as a tool for hackers and developers.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So here is my use case: I own 2 prepaid SIMs for which I regularly run over my internet quota. Vodafone has a promotion where it offers you 2Mb for every call you give or receive, that is over one minute long. The problem is, I don't really talk for more than 20 minutes each month. So, as the bright engineer that I am, I've come up with a plan. Since I have unlimited calls between my two prepaid SIMs, why not have them call each other, and farm some megabytes.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Here is where Firefox OS comes in. It's insanely easy for me to script together some code that would call a number, wait for 60 seconds, end the call and call again.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><div style="text-align: justify;"><code>function start() {</code><br /><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; navigator.mozTelephony.dial('07XXXXXXXX'); // Call the phone number</code><br /><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setTimeout(stop, 63*1000); // Stop the call in 63 seconds</code><br /><code>}</code><br /><code></code><br /><code>function stop() {</code><br /><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; navigator.mozTelephony.calls[0].hangUp(); // Hang up</code><br /><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setTimeout(start, 3*1000); // Call back again in another 3 seconds</code><br /><code>}</code><br /><code></code><br /><code>start(); </code></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I just opened the App Manager, and pasted the code into the Usage app console. Then I left it running for about one night, and got around 1.5 Gb of traffic. (The max I can get is 2.5 Gb) Pretty nice, right? One of the problems in this setup, is that I needed to download an app on my Android phone, to answer incoming calls automatically. I went with AutoAnswer, but wasn't really happy with the permission settings the app required. This is another way Firefox OS kicks Android's app. It has a way better permissions system, where each app asks for each permission, and can still function if you don't allow it.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So there it is. With less than 10 lines of code, I was able to make use of the phone's capabilities in a very cool way. That was way easier and much more fun than anything I could do with my Raspberry Pi. Soon, with the launch of a device that costs around 25$, it will be even cheaper than a RPi. And I can only imagine what I could do with the the available camera and wireless capabilities.</div><code></code></div>
