<div style="text-align: justify;">Movies have always been a big part of my life. I can honestly say a large part of my personality, my likes and dislikes and my overall attitude towards life can be at least partly attributed to the movies I've seen.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A few years ago I decided to start a list on IMDb, to try to determine how many movies I've watched my whole life. That list is up to around 600 movies right now, and it's not even close to finished. There are many movies I forgot to put on the list, and many movies I still haven't watched.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I've clearly spent a few months of my life watching movies (part of them I watched more than once, some of them I watched up to 20-30 times). And I haven't even counted the hours I spent watching Friends, Scrubs, Futurama, Stargate, House, and the list goes on. And I also watched countless hours of stand-up.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Was that time wasted? Yes, and no. As I said, I've learned a lot from movies, about culture, history and language. Things I would miss about myself if I were to suddenly forget them. A lot of good movies, but I also think I wasted a bunch of time with some of them. No, not the bad ones </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">No, movies aren't good or bad, it's more a matter of preferences and state of mind. The movies that I find to be worth watching are the ones that change something about me, that touch something in my heart or mind and stay with me for months. <i>The departed</i> was a movie that didn't impress me much. I found it pointless. Not to say that the direction or acting wasn't good, they were. <i>The hurt locker</i> though... I still wish I could get back the time I wasted watching it.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">My favourite movies? For a long time it was Phone Book. Then Equilibrium. Inception also rated very high in my book. There's a huge list of movies I loved (maybe I'll blog my top 10-50 sometime in the future).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><i><b>One of the best movies I've seen last year was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194499/">About Time</a>. Incredibly hilarious and bitter-sweet movie, that ended on an optimistic note that strongly resonated with the way I like to live my life.</b></i></span><br /><br /><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><i><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">EOF</span></span></i></b></div>
